    * Constructor now accepts a list as well as a hashref
    * New method added: run_command, allows multiple instances of D::C
      in the same script.  Accepts the action as an argument and returns
      the exit code the user should exit with.
    * do_foreground added to allow running the code ref or program w/o forking
    * DC_FOREGROUND env will force foreground, regardless of compile-time settings
    * foreground added to constructor -- shortcut to fork => 0, quiet => 1
    * Calling the script without an argument results in the syntax being displayed
    * Stray exit removed for run_command
    * Updated documentation

    * Due to checking for true values instead of define it was
      possible to start a daemon as root by setting uid/gid to 0/0,
      but not user/group to root/root, which would resolve to 0/0 and
      be considered an invalid user, which it's not.
    * Fix an encoding error in the POD resulting from Ævar Arnfjörð
      Bjarmason contributing to the project.
    * Tests that invoke Perl now use $^X instead of the $PATH's perl.

      full kill_timeout duration
    * new option: prereq_no_process
    * stdout is flushed immediately when diagnostic output is printed
