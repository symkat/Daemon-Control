    * Due to checking for true values instead of define it was
      possible to start a daemon as root by setting uid/gid to 0/0,
      but not user/group to root/root, which would resolve to 0/0 and
      be considered an invalid user, which it's not.
    * Fix an encoding error in the POD resulting from Ævar Arnfjörð
      Bjarmason contributing to the project.
    * Tests that invoke Perl now use $^X instead of the $PATH's perl.
    * properly write the pid file in single fork mode (github#XXX)

    * create dir for pid_file if it does not exist
    * fix uninitialized warning in error when exec fails
    * 'stop' is now faster when kill_timeout is set to high values, by checking

      full kill_timeout duration
    * new option: prereq_no_process
    * stdout is flushed immediately when diagnostic output is printed
